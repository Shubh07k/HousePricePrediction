# House Price Prediction :house_with_garden:

Housing Market is among most volatile markets. Various parameters affect the pricing of a unit. Due to which many genuine but also bogus factors can be brought in to manipulate prices . Aim here is to predict pricing considering various genuine factors while learning and implementing statical algorithms, Machine Learning, Data Analytics using Python , Pyspark, MongoDB, Power BI and to deploy it using User interface base models in Heroku Cloud

ML-Notebook
  We have performed different Regression models to predict the price of Houses based on Featured selecte. XGBoost achieved R2 score of 0.8882 which is better than other Machine Learning models
"/" Linear Regression
  Lasso Regression
  Ridge Regression
  Elastic Net Regression
  DecisionTree Regression
  RandomForest Regression
  KNN Regression
  XGBoost Regression
  
Visualization
  Data Visualization is graphical representation of information and data by using tools like charts,graphs,maps.This tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends,patterns in data.
  We have used PowerBI for Visualization

we have deployed our project on Heroku cloud :
